# CourseTool
Hello!

CourseTool is my attempt at designing a college schedule planner app. Currently, this will be based and tested around The Ohio State University's course offerings, but should eventually achieve generic functionality.

# VSC Setup

Requirements
* Java openjdk 17+ | Linked thru sys path
* JavaFX sdk 21+ | File path configured in both launch.json "vmArgs" and project reference libraries.


All content in this repo is likely to change as I complete functionality. I'm still new-ish to Java, so expect a few cobwebs as I get my bearings and get things going. :D
