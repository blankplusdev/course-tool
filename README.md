# CourseTool
Hello!

CourseTool is my attempt at designing a college schedule planner app. Currently, this will be based and tested around The Ohio State University's course offerings, but should eventually achieve generic functionality.

All content in this repo is likely to change as I complete functionality. I'm still new-ish to Java, so expect a few cobwebs as I get my bearings and get things going. :D
