# CourseTool
Hello!

Gradentia is my attempt at designing a college curriculum planner. Currently, this will be based and tested around The Ohio State University's course offerings, but should eventually achieve generic functionality.

All content in this repo is likely to change as I complete functionality. I'm still learning Java, so expect a few cobwebs as I get my bearings and get things going. :D
